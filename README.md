# Valcour's Theater

Valcour's theater is a short game for the 2026 Global Game Jam, where me and 5 other people, partnered together to create a first person horror game.

You have been hired to prepare a stage in a theater that has been closed for years.
No one comes anymore, but the work must be done.

Your task is to complete a series of stage-preparation duties to get the play ready. Move props, arrange the space, and finish what was left unfinished.

The Valcour Theater was abandoned after its last performance, when the lead actor disappeared in front of the audience. Since then, something lingers backstage.

You wear a mask that doesn’t belong to you.
Some things only exist while you’re wearing it.
And something in this theater doesn’t want the play to be ready.

Controls:

WASD - Move

SPACE - Use mask

L_SHIFT - Run

E - Interact with crank

Q - Show/Hide instructions

R - Engine Skillcheck
